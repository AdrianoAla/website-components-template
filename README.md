# Uniweb Modules

This repository is a template for creating **modules** suitable to be used in websites made with [Uniweb CMS](https://uniwebcms.com). A Uniweb module is a collection of web blocks and components.

The [module development documentation](https://help.uniweb.app/) explains the programming framework, which is based on [React JS](https://react.dev/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

:stopwatch: It should take about 5 minutes to get started building and testing a module using this repository.

## Getting started

Your first goal is to create your own repository and connect it live with a Uniweb website so that you can create and modify web components and see the results instantly.

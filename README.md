# Uniweb Modules

This repository is a template for creating **modules** suitable to be used in websites made with [Uniweb CMS](https://uniwebcms.com). A Uniweb module is a collection of web blocks and components.

The [module development documentation](https://help.uniweb.app/) explains the programming framework, which is based on [React JS](https://react.dev/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

:stopwatch: It should take about 5 minutes to get started building and testing a module using this repository. 

<!-- You do not need to install any tools. All you need is a free [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) project and edit access to a Uniweb website. It is also possible to build and test your component collections locally. -->

## Getting started

Your first goal is to create your own repository and connect it live with a Uniweb website so that you can create and modify web components and see the results instantly.

Begin by [configuring the development toolchain](https://github.com/uniwebcms/uniweb-module-builder/blob/main/docs/dev_toolchain.md). Next, build module files on your computer and make them publicly reachable [using a web server and a tunnel](https://github.com/uniwebcms/uniweb-module-builder/blob/main/docs/dev_with_tunnel.md).

Once you are comfortable developing web components for website templates, the final step is to [release a production version](https://github.com/uniwebcms/uniweb-module-builder/blob/main/docs/prod_distribution.md) of a module and distribute it via Cloudflare.
